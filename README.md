# SCBCarnivalPPPOS
Simple POS system for the Pete's Place bar at the SCB Carnival.

All menu items are listed in the products.js and then it builds the dynamic touch screen system. It will keep a running reciept of what is being ordered, the cost, and calculate the change. 

Very basic.

Built on BootStrap
